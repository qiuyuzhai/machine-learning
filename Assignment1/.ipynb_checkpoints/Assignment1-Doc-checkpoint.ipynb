        "## Goal\n",
        "In this assignment, the task is predict whether an SMS message is a real message, a spam message, or a phishing message (called smishing). Here are some examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Normal**: \"For real tho this sucks. I can't even cook my whole electricity is out. And I'm hungry.\"\n",
        "  - **Spam**: \"Had your mobile 10 mths? Update to latest Orange camera/video phones for FREE. Save £s with Free texts/weekend calls. Text YES for a callback orno to opt out\"\n",
        "  - **Smishing**: \"Todays Vodafone numbers ending 5347 are selected to receive a Rs.2,00,000 award. If you have a match please call 6299257179 quoting claim code 2041 standard rates apply\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to train a classifier to predict the class from the SMS text.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "You need to train classifiers using the training data, and then predict on the test data. You are free to choose the feature extraction method and classifier algorithm.  You are free to use methods that were not introduced in class.  You should probably do cross-validation to select a good parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "You need to report your test predictions. The csv file has determined the split of validation and test data, where the validation data will be used to determine the timestep of checkpointing. The model that achieves the best performance on validation set should be used to evaluate the test data. The test performance will be used to calculate your final ranking.\n",
        "\n",
        "The evaluation metric is **balanced accuracy score**. This is because the dataset has some class imbalance as there are more normal samples than spam/smishing samples. See details for `sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score` [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "## What to hand in\n",
        "You need to turn in the following things:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. This ipynb file `Assignment1-Doc.ipynb` with your source code and documentation. _**You should write about all the various attempts that you make to find a good solution.**_ You may also submit python scripts as source code, but you then must document all analysis and results (figures, outputs, etc.) in the ipynb file.\n",
        "2. The PDF file exported from your `Assignment1-Doc.ipynb` file.\n",
        "3. Your final CSV submission file on test data.\n",
        "4. The ipynb file `Assignment1-Final.ipynb`, which contains the code that generates the final CSV submission file.  **This code will be used to verify that your submission is reproducible.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Please compress all four files into a single zipfile and upload it to Assignment 1 on Canvas.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Basic Requirements of Documentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "For your documentation, you need to at least explain the following things:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Preprocessing**: This section should detail your exploratory data analysis and the rationale behind all preprocessing steps.\n",
        "  - Describe the initial characteristics of your dataset.\n",
        "  - Explain all techniques you have applied on the data\n",
        "  - Clearly state which subset of the data was used to determine any inherent hyperparameters within your preprocessing techniques, ensuring no information from the test set was used (if any)\n",
        "- **Methodology**: you will justify your modeling choices.\n",
        "  - Chosen Models: describe the core principle or model architecture (for deep learning)\n",
        "  - Chosen Optimizers (if any)\n",
        "  - Chosen Loss Function (if any)\n",
        "- **Hyperparameters**: This section should demonstrate a rigorous approach to hyper-parameter selection\n",
        "  - List the key hyperparameters used\n",
        "  - Document your hyperparameter search process. Compare model performance on a dedicated validation set and select the best-performing configuration based solely on validation metrics. As a core principle of this course, using the test set for hyperparameter selection is strictly prohibited and constitutes academic dishonesty.\n",
        "- **Results and Visualization**: This section should provide clear evidence of your model's performance and a qualitative analysis of its behavior.\n",
        "  - Learning Curves (only for deep learning methods): the loss (error) and/or accuracy on training and validation set must be provided.\n",
        "  - Show examples of correctly classified and misclassified test samples. For misclassified samples, hypothesize why the model failed.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Grading\n",
        "The marks of the assignment are distributed as follows:\n",
        "- 45% - Results using various classifiers and feature representations.\n",
        "- 30% - Trying out feature representations (e.g. adding additional features) or classifiers not used in the tutorials/lectures.\n",
        "- 20% - Quality of the written report.  More points for insightful observations and analysis.\n",
        "- 5% - Final performance on the test data. If a submission cannot be reproduced by the submitted code, it will not receive marks for ranking.\n",
        "- **Late Penalty:** 25 marks will be subtracted for each day late.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** This is an _individual_ assignment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** you should start early! Some classifiers may take a while to train.\n",
